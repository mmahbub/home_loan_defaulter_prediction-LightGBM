# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction
Implementations of several machine learning algorithms with a goal to predict loan applicantsâ€™ repayment capability. For the analysis and prediction, data sets from one of the Kaggle competetions have been used. The implemented algorithms are statistical and parametric Gaussian Naive-Bayes (Gaussian NB), non-parametric k-nearest neighbors (kNN), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine classifier (SVC) and a gradient boosting framework based on non-statistical tree-based learning algorithm lightGBM (LGBM). Being exposed to a class imbalance problem, the models have been evaluated based on their Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC-AUC) which was also the evaluation metric for the Kaggle competition. After building the baseline models, two best performing ones, lightGBM and logistic regression have been improved upon their baseline AUC.
