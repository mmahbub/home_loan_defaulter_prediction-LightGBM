    "# Introduction: Automated Feature Engineering Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through applying automated feature engineering to the [Home Credit Default Risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) using the featuretools library. [Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/) is an open-source Python package for automatically creating new features from multiple tables of structured, related data. It is ideal tool for problems such as the Home Credit Default Risk competition where there are several related tables that need to be combined into a single dataframe for training (and one for testing). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of [feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) is to create new features (alos called explantory variables or predictors) to represent as much information from an entire dataset in one table.  Typically, this process is done by hand using pandas operations such as `groupby`, `agg`, or `merge` and can be very tedious. Moreover, manual feature engineering is limited both by human time constraints and imagination: we simply cannot conceive of every possible feature that will be useful. (For an example of using manual feature engineering, check out [part one](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering) and [part two](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering-p2) applied to this competition). The importance of creating the proper features cannot be overstated because a machine learning model can only learn from the data we give to it. Extracting as much information as possible from the available datasets is crucial to creating an effective solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Automated feature engineering](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-feature-engineering-in-python-99baf11cc219) aims to help the data scientist with the problem of feature creation by automatically building hundreds or thousands of new features from a dataset. Featuretools - the only library for automated feature engineering at the moment - will not replace the data scientist, but it will allow her to focus on more valuable parts of the machine learning pipeline, such as delivering robust models into production. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will touch on the concepts of automated feature engineering with featuretools and show how to implement it for the Home Credit Default Risk competition. We will stick to the basics so we can get the ideas down and then build upon this foundation in later work when we customize featuretools. We will work with a subset of the data because this is a computationally intensive job that is outside the capabilities of the Kaggle kernels. I took the work done in this notebook and ran the methods on the entire dataset with the results [available here](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/home-credit-default-risk-feature-tools). At the end of this notebook, we'll look at the features themselves, as well as the results of modeling with different combinations of hand designed and automatically built features. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to this competition, I suggest checking out [this post to get started](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction). For a good take on why features are so important, here's a [blog post](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/secret-to-data-science-success/) by one of the developers of Featuretools. "

    "# Featuretools Basics\n",

    "[Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/#minute-quick-start) is an open-source Python library for automatically creating features out of a set of related tables using a technique called [deep feature synthesis](http://www.jmaxkanter.com/static/papers/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf). Automated feature engineering, like many topics in machine learning, is a complex subject built upon a foundation of simpler ideas. By going through these ideas one at a time, we can build up our understanding of how featuretools which will later allow for us to get the most out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few concepts that we will cover along the way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Entities and EntitySets](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html)\n",

    "# Entities and Entitysets\n",
    "\n",
    "An entity is simply a table or in Pandas, a `dataframe`. The observations are in the rows and the features in the columns. An entity in featuretools must have a unique index where none of the elements are duplicated.  Currently, only `app`, `bureau`, and `previous` have unique indices (`SK_ID_CURR`, `SK_ID_BUREAU`, and `SK_ID_PREV` respectively). For the other dataframes, we must pass in `make_index = True` and then specify the name of the index. Entities can also have time indices where each entry is identified by a unique time. (There are not datetimes in any of the data, but there are relative times, given in months or days, that we could consider treating as time variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "An [EntitySet](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html) is a collection of tables and the relationships between them. This can be thought of a data structute with its own methods and attributes. Using an EntitySet allows us to group together multiple tables and manipulate them much quicker than individual tables. \n",

Each individual in the parent table can have multiple rows in the _child table_. \n",

    "Slightly advanced note: we need to be careful to not create a [diamond graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_graph) where there are multiple paths from a parent to a child. If we directly link `app` and `cash` via `SK_ID_CURR`; `previous` and `cash` via `SK_ID_PREV`; and `app` and `previous` via `SK_ID_CURR`, then we have created two paths from `app` to `cash`. This results in ambiguity, so the approach we have to take instead is to link `app` to `cash` through `previous`. We establish a relationship between `previous` (the parent) and `cash` (the child) using `SK_ID_PREV`. Then we establish a relationship between `app` (the parent) and `previous` (now the child) using `SK_ID_CURR`. Then featuretools will be able to create features on `app` derived from both `previous` and `cash` by stacking multiple primitives. "

    "# Feature Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "A [feature primitive](https://docs.featuretools.com/automated_feature_engineering/primitives.html) is an operation applied to a table or a set of tables to create a feature. These represent simple calculations, many of which we already use in manual feature engineering, that can be stacked on top of each other to create complex features. Feature primitives fall into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Aggregation__: function that groups together child datapoints for each parent and then calculates a statistic such as mean, min, max, or standard deviation. An example is calculating the maximum previous loan amount for each client. An aggregation works across multiple tables using relationships between tables.\n",
    "* __Transformation__: an operation applied to one or more columns in a single table. An example would be taking the absolute value of a column, or finding the difference between two columns in one table.\n",

    "# Deep Feature Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) is the process featuretools uses to make new features. DFS stacks feature primitives to form features with a \"depth\" equal to the number of primitives. For example, if we take the maximum value of a client's previous loans (say `MAX(previous.loan_amount)`), that is a \"deep feature\" with a depth of 1. To create a feature with a depth of two, we could stack primitives by taking the maximum value of a client's average montly payments per previous loan (such as `MAX(previous(MEAN(installments.payment)))`). The [original paper on automated feature engineering using deep feature synthesis](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf) is worth a read. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform DFS in featuretools, we use the `dfs`  function passing it an `entityset`, the `target_entity` (where we want to make the features), the `agg_primitives` to use, the `trans_primitives` to use and the `max_depth` of the features. Here we will use the default aggregation and transformation primitives,  a max depth of 2, and calculate primitives for the `app` entity. Because this process is computationally expensive, we can run the function using `features_only = True` to return only a list of the features and not calculate the features themselves. This can be useful to look at the resulting features before starting an extended computation."

The vital role of the data scientist now comes down to choosing the correct set of primitives and selecting the best features from among all the candidates. "

    "Next we can look at correlations within the data. When we look at correlations with the target, we need to be careful about the [multiple comparisons problem](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-multiple-comparisons-problem-e5573e8b9578): if we make a ton of features, some are likely to be correlated with the target simply because of random noise. Using correlations is fine as a first approximation for identifying \"good features\", but it is not a rigorous feature selection method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, based on examining some of the features, it seems there might be issues with [collinearity between features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) made by featuretools. Features that are highly correlated with one another can diminish interpretability and generalization performance on the test set. In an ideal scenario, we would have a set of independent features, but that rarely occurs in practice. If there are very highly correlated varibables, we might want to think about removing some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the correlations, we will focus on the `feature_matrix_spec`, the features we made by specifying the primitives. The same analysis could be applied to the default feature set. These correlations were calculated using the entire training section of the feature matrix."
